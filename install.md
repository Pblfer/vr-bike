# Installation / Manual

## Uniduino
Uniduino is a non free asset, so it has been git ignored.  This
distribution should work if you install Uniduino from the Unity
Asset Store in the folder
    
    unity/Assets/Uniduino


## What's included so far?
2 game demos:  a riding game and a shooting game that both use
the cycle controller.


## Ideas
1) Create a more robust prefab out of the cycle controller code
that could easily be included in any separate project.
