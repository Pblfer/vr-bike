This project uses non-free assets from the Unity Asset Store.  The complete
project is stored in this repo for reference only (i.e. so that hobbyists might build their own sensors and learn how the character controller for the bicycle is put together.)

You are NOT FREE to re-distribute this app in any form except for non-commercial personal play of the game.  You are DEFINITELY NOT FREE to steal paid assets from this repository for use in other projects in order to circumvent paying for them on the Unity Asset Store.
