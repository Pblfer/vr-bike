# VR Bike #
By Sam Halperin

##Contents of this repo##
+ arduino sketches:  for debugging your hardware.  Once it's working with these sketches upload the standard firmata.
+ circuit diagrams
+ parts list
+ images of sensor
+ unity:  currently 2 fairly blank race track scenes.  One configured for Rift, the other not.

##Demos##
+ Various builds including a demo game** in progress.

##Software Required to work with this repo##
+ Unity (Pro required for Oculus Rift Build)
+ UniDunio (From asset store.  I think it's $10)

## Documentation of VR Bike Character Controller ##
The code is in flux enough that detailed documentation of how it works probably doesn't make sense.  For now, read the code and see:
